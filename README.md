## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### What I learned


Learned a new way of naming classes in HTML, here is an example:
```html
<div class="faq__answer"></div>

```

Added this to my `reset.css` style file:
```css
:root {
  font-size: 62.5%;
}

a,
a:hover,
a:focus,
a:active {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: inherit;
}

button {
  border: none;
  outline: none;
  background: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  padding: 0;
}
```

How to click an element with javascript:
```js

questions[1].click();

```



### Continued development

CSS Grid
